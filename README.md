# synesthesia

An art gallery with a vision to emulate a voluntary synesthetic experience.

The motivation behind this installation, is to provide a vantage point into the life of people with the type of synesthesia, who experience color as sounds.

It is also a take on how [Neil Harbisson](https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_harbisson_i_listen_to_color?language=en_), a color-blind artist, experiences color as sound.
